In my PhD, I developed a Spleen-on-Chip model to study the mechanical properties of red blood cells (RBCs). This innovative microfluidic device mimics the spleen's microenvironment, enabling precise analysis of RBC deformability under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions. The project involved advanced techniques such as microfabrication, cell culture, and finite element analysis (FEA) to design and validate the device. This model has potential applications in understanding blood disorders and developing targeted therapies. My work culminated in significant insights into RBC behavior, contributing to the advancement of organ-on-chip technology.

Utilized COMSOL Multiphysics to simulate and optimize the microfluidic device design. These simulations were crucial in understanding fluid dynamics, shear stresses, and particle behavior within the chip. By leveraging COMSOL, I refined the design parameters to ensure accurate replication of the spleen's microenvironment, enhancing the device's performance and reliability for studying red blood cell mechanics and interactions. This process demonstrated my expertise in computational modeling and its application to microfluidic device development.

Advanced microfabrication techniques to create precise and functional microfluidic devices. I utilized photolithography and backside lithography to design and fabricate intricate microchannel structures that mimic the spleen's microenvironment. These techniques allowed for high-resolution patterning and ensured the scalability of the device. Additionally, soft lithography using PDMS (polydimethylsiloxane) was employed to construct the chip, offering flexibility and biocompatibility essential for cellular studies. My proficiency in microfabrication ensured the development of a robust platform for studying red blood cell mechanics.
